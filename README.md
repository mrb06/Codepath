## Hello World

### App Description
Using Android Studio to program an app to change the background, text color, and text information using a button as an user interface.

### App Walk-though
I am currently in the Dominican Republic and have very limited internet. I recorded my screen using Recordit but could not generate the GIF link due to very slow upload speeds. I can upload or email the GIF after I come back on September 12th if possible. I hope you understand.
